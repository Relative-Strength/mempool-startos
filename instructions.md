# Mempool 

Mempool is an open-source explorer developed for the Bitcoin community, focusing on the emerging transaction fee market to help our transition into a multi-layer ecosystem. 

## Configuration

Mempool on the Start9 Server requires a fully synced archival Bitcoin Core node to function.

This implementation of Mempool on the Start9 Server enables you to connect to your own Bitcoin Core node.

As of Mempool v2.5.0, you can optionally enable the Lightning Tab. This requires you to have either LND or Core Lightning running on your Start9 Server.

## Lightning

Once the Lightning tab is enabled, you are able to see information across the entire lightining network, including statistics about your own lightning node. Choosing LND or Core Lightning provide similar network data, but may have different quantities of historical data depending on the age of your lightning node. 

## Mining

The Mining tab provides network information about bitcoin mining statistics and 3rd party information about known mining pools connected to each confirmed block. 

## Address Lookups

To enable address lookups, open the configuration menu and set Address Indexer to your preferred option:

- Electrs: Small and good for light use.
- Fulcrum: Much faster thane Electrs, especially for addresses with many transactions. Uses slightly more storage than Electrs.
- Disabled: Turns off address lookups.

You will need the selected indexer to be installed and fully synced before this feature will work. Also, lookups may be slow or time out while the service is still warming up, or if your system is under heavy load. If address lookups arenâ€™t working, try restarting the selected indexer and try the lookup again.

## Acceleration

Accelerating mempool transactions allows them to be prioritized by mining pools thus reducing the wait time for the first confirmation. Visit an unconfirmed transaction in the mempool interface and select the "Accelerate" button near ETA. Follow the on-screen instructions to increase the sat/vB and submit payment via lightning invoice.
